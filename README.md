# Dart-Lesson4
This is the fourth lesson of Dart

This project includes code snippets that showcase various fundamental programming concepts in Dart, as follows:

1. Date and Time Operations: Includes obtaining the current date/time, calculating a future date, parsing a date string, formatting dates and times, and finding the difference between dates. Additional helper functions format date/time elements with leading zeros and provide month abbreviations.

2. Enum Usage: Demonstrates an enum representing the days of the week, with examples of how to use enums with switch statements, iterate over values, and retrieve an enum's name.

3. Asynchronous Programming: Implements asynchronous programming with Dartâ€™s 'Future', simulating a network request and utilizing 'async'/'await' for non-blocking operation management.

4. String Manipulation:

    1. Concatenation: Merges two strings into one.
    2. Interpolation: Embeds variables and expressions directly within strings.
    3. Substring Extraction: Uses the 'substring()' method to retrieve specific portions of a string.


HAPPY CODING!!!
